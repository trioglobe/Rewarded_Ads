# Rewarded_Ads
Ads that users can choose to view in exchange for an in-app reward — such as watching a video ad to get an extra life in a game, read a news article, or access Wi-Fi at an airport — are called “rewarded ads.” These ad experiences can keep users more engaged and offer a better overall app experience.
